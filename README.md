# -Internet-Shopping-

This application uses object relational mapping (ORM) to help manipulate data the a database. Here, the app uses express.js and sequelize to interact with mySQL 
database. Once the user opens up insonmia, the user is able to add new, update or delete products, tags, and categories. The user can also associate 
products, tags, and categories when they create one. For example, when a user creates a "blue hat" product, they are able to put the a tag id number under products so that the "blue hat" product has that specific tag id under it. This is a way to help organize online shopping catelogs for users.
